# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Project Overview
    The purpose of this analysis is to perform various analyses using several supervised machine learning techniques in order to determine varying levels of credit risk. The algorithms used in said in analysis include SMOTE, SMOTEENN, Cluster Centroids, RandomOverSampler, and Easy Ensemble Classifier. As per Jill, we've been asked to determine which loans can be considered high or low risk, which can be a challenge due to the fact that there are more low risk loans as opposed to high risk loans. With these machine learning techniques we can get a clearer picture of which loans are high or low risk.
